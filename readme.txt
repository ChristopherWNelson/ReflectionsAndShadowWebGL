-Description-
reflections_and_shadows.html is a WebGL program that draws a superquadric on top of a flat
surface and displays a shadows and reflection on the surface. This was done using WebGL's
stencil buffer and alpha blending to render the scene. The reflection is the superquadric
flipped upside down and blended with the surface. The shadow is the superquadric flattened
and blended with the surface as well.
